Remember that Generic LL class you wrote for project 1? Your job is to implement the Junit test functions given in the
GenericLLTester class.

Don't change the augment of the provided code unless you want to change it everywhere in the test file.

IMPORTANT: Be sure you pay attention to the names of the provided tests. If you implement a test, but it doesn't match
what the name of the test implies it should be testing for, you will lose the points the autograder gives you when
the exams are manually reviewed by myself and the TAs.

ALSO IMPORTANT: Do not write more test than the ones I provided. Goes without saying, but don't write less either.

TIP: I recommend having more than one assert for some of your tests (or potentially putting your assert in a loop).
Remember that even though we should only test 1 thing per unit test, we can still use multiple asserts in a single test
so long as the X number of asserts all test the same thing.
