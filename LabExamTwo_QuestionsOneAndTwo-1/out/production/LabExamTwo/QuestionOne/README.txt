Introduction:
    You have two class files: a genericLL class (which is supposed to be a generic linked list) and a driver.
    However, If you look at the genericLL class, you'll notice that it's not generic. It only holds doubles.

TODO:
    * Your job for this question is to convert the genericLL from the Double LL it currently is into a generic version.
    Note that you don't need to convert any of the contracts. They're just there to tell you what each function does.
    * Once you've converted genericLL into a generic linked list, you need to follow the directions in the driver file for
    instructions on how to implement the driver.
    * The autograder will grade you based on the output your driver provides, so things like variables names are not important

IMPORTANT:
    USING JAVA'S BUILT IN LINKED LIST CLASS (or any of its other List structures) WILL RESULT IN A ZERO FOR THE ENTIRE EXAM.
